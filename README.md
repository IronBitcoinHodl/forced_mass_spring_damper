# forced_mass_spring_damper
An attempt to model the oscillations around the S2FX model with a forced mass spring damper

This is an attempt to model the price swings with a mechanical equivalent model, to quantify if there are any discernable trends. The inputs to the forced mass spring damper is the SFX value, similar to consecutive step functions. This input forces a spring damper system with unknown spring constant k and damping constant d (or are they constants?) which in turn drives a mental mass m. Not sure anymore, where I picked up this term, but might have been Chad Saylor. A proxy for the mental mass could for instance be the following of a OG twitter account.
